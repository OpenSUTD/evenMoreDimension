### What's it do?
It's the source code for a chrome extension that improves eDimension.

Specifically, it currently does 2 things, currently.
1. Add download buttons to all files/documents (so you don't have to keep)
2. Makes eDimension look *better*.

### Why make this?
We're a tech and design school, and our LMS doesn't fit in. It's archaic, ugly and the experience of using it just isn't great. This is an attempt to make it better.


### Why is Google Analytics in there?
Yeah, privacy's a big concern. GA keeps everything completely anonymous though, so don't worry about that. Who you are will never be known. I added it in for future planning. I'd like for us to be able to go to the school with hard data to say that eDimension clearly doesn't fit the theme of technology and design. It looks like it was made before the school was even born. Enough people using the augmented version would help prove that it sucks. Also, in the spirit of complete honesty, I'm curious about general usage statistics.

### Future plans?
[ ] Add recursive download button to download the entire week's documents all at once.
