## What is this and what's it do?
It's the source code for a chrome extension that improves eDimension.

Specifically, it currently does 2 things, currently.
1. Add download buttons to all files/documents (so you don't have to keep)
2. Makes eDimension look *better*.

## Why make this?
We're a tech and design school, and our LMS doesn't fit in. It's archaic, ugly and the experience of using it just isn't great. This is an attempt to make it better.

## Future plans?
[ ] Add recursive download button to download the entire week's documents all at once.

[ ] Semantic filenames when downloading. I hate it when PDFs are hard to identify (e.g. 154389341.pdf instead of HW1.pdf)
